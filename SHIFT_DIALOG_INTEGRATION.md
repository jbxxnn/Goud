# Shift Dialog Integration

## Overview

The shift creation and editing functionality has been integrated directly into the calendar UI using the built-in dialog system instead of a separate drawer component.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `AddShiftDialog` Component

**File**: `calendar/components/dialogs/add-shift-dialog.tsx`

This new component replaces the demo `AddEventDialog` with a fully functional shift creation dialog that:
- ✅ Opens when clicking on any time slot in the calendar
- ✅ Pre-fills the start date/time based on where you clicked
- ✅ Fetches staff, locations, and services from the API
- ✅ Supports all shift features (recurring, services, max bookings, notes, priority)
- ✅ Validates form data
- ✅ Handles conflict detection
- ✅ Refreshes the calendar after successful creation
- ✅ Compact design optimized for quick shift creation

### 2. Integrated Into Calendar Views

**Files Modified**:
- `calendar/components/week-and-day-view/calendar-week-view.tsx`
- `calendar/components/week-and-day-view/calendar-day-view.tsx`

Replaced all instances of `AddEventDialog` with `AddShiftDialog` so that:
- Every clickable time slot in Week View opens the shift dialog
- Every clickable time slot in Day View opens the shift dialog
- The dialog pre-fills with the clicked time slot's date and time

### 3. Added "Add Shift" Button to Header

**Files Modified**:
- `components/shift-calendar-header.tsx`

Changes:
- Added "Add Shift" button after the staff filter dropdown
- Button opens the same `AddShiftDialog`
- Button click does not pre-fill date/time (user enters manually)

### 4. Updated Container and Client Components

**Files Modified**:
- `components/shift-calendar-container.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/shifts/shifts-client.tsx`

Changes:
- Added `onShiftCreated` callback prop that propagates from calendar to client
- Removed `ShiftModal` component usage
- Calendar automatically refreshes after shift creation

## How It Works

### User Flow

**Option 1: Click "Add Shift" Button**
1. **Open Calendar**: Navigate to `/dashboard/shifts`
2. **Click "Add Shift"**: Button located in the header after the staff filter dropdown
3. **Dialog Opens**: The shift creation dialog appears
4. **Fill Form**: Complete all fields (staff, location, date/time, services)
5. **Create Shift**: Click "Create Shift"
6. **Auto-Refresh**: Dialog closes and calendar refreshes to show the new shift

**Option 2: Click Time Slot (Quick Create)**
1. **Open Calendar**: Navigate to `/dashboard/shifts`
2. **Click Time Slot**: Click on any time block in the calendar grid
3. **Dialog Opens**: The shift creation dialog appears
4. **Pre-filled Data**: Start date and time are automatically set based on where you clicked
5. **Fill Form**: Complete the required fields (staff, location, services)
6. **Create Shift**: Click "Create Shift"
7. **Auto-Refresh**: Dialog closes and calendar refreshes to show the new shift

### Technical Flow

```
User clicks time slot
  ↓
AddShiftDialog opens
  ↓
Fetches staff/locations/services
  ↓
User fills form
  ↓
POST /api/shifts
  ↓
onShiftCreated callback fires
  ↓
shifts-client.tsx calls fetchShifts()
  ↓
Calendar re-renders with new shift
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Better UX**
- ✅ Faster workflow - click exactly where you want the shift
- ✅ Pre-filled date/time reduces data entry
- ✅ Contextual - dialog appears right where you're working
- ✅ Matches calendar UX patterns

### 2. **Cleaner UI**
- ✅ No separate "Add Shift" button needed
- ✅ Dialog is more compact than drawer
- ✅ Less screen real estate used
- ✅ More intuitive for calendar users

### 3. **More Flexible**
- ✅ Can create shifts from Week View
- ✅ Can create shifts from Day View
- ✅ Works at any time slot with 15-minute increments
- ✅ Easy to create multiple shifts quickly

## Differences from Original Drawer

### Removed Features (from drawer):
- ❌ Full-width drawer from the right
- ❌ Editing shifts (will be added later via click on shift blocks)

### Added Features (in dialog):
- ✅ "Add Shift" button in calendar header (after staff filter)
- ✅ Auto-filled start/end times based on click location
- ✅ Compact form design
- ✅ Integrated into calendar UI
- ✅ Faster creation workflow
- ✅ Two ways to create shifts (button or click time slot)

## Creating Shifts Now

### Method 1: "Add Shift" Button
1. Click the **"Add Shift"** button in the calendar header
2. Dialog opens (no pre-filled times)
3. Manually select date, start time, and end time
4. Complete form and create shift

### Method 2: Click Time Slot (Week View)
1. Navigate to Week View
2. Click on any time slot (every 15 minutes)
3. Dialog opens with that time pre-filled
4. Complete form and create shift

### Method 3: Click Time Slot (Day View)
1. Navigate to Day View
2. Click on any time slot (every 15 minutes)
3. Dialog opens with that time pre-filled
4. Complete form and create shift

### Default Behavior:
- **Button click**: No pre-filled times (you enter everything)
- **Time slot click**: Start time = clicked time, End time = 1 hour later

## Next Steps

### Planned Enhancements:

1. **Edit Shift Dialog**
   - Click on existing shift block to edit
   - Pre-fill form with existing shift data
   - Update shift via PUT request

2. **Shift Details Popover**
   - Hover over shift to see details
   - Quick actions (edit, delete, duplicate)

3. **Drag & Drop**
   - Drag shifts to different time slots
   - Drag to resize shift duration

4. **Bulk Operations**
   - Select multiple shifts
   - Copy/paste shifts
   - Bulk delete

## Migration Notes

If you have existing code that uses `ShiftModal`:
- Replace with clicking on calendar time slots
- Remove `ShiftModal` imports and usage
- Remove "Add Shift" button if custom
- Pass `onShiftCreated` callback to `ShiftCalendarContainer`
