## 🚀 How to Use

### Access the Shift Management Page
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/shifts` (Admin only)
2. You'll see a calendar view with existing shifts
3. Click "Add Shift" to create a new shift

### Create a Shift
1. Click the **"Add Shift"** button
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Staff Member**: Select who will work this shift
   - **Location**: Where the shift takes place
   - **Start/End Time**: When the shift occurs
   - **Recurring**: Toggle if this repeats
     - Choose frequency (Daily/Weekly/Monthly)
     - For weekly: Select days of week
     - Set end date (optional)
   - **Services**: Select which services can be booked
   - **Max Bookings**: Set concurrent booking limits per service
   - **Priority**: Higher numbers take precedence for overlaps
   - **Notes**: Add any additional information
3. Click **"Create Shift"**

### View Shifts in Calendar
- **Week View**: See all shifts for the current week
- **Filter by Staff**: Use the calendar's user filter
- **Color Coded**: Different colors for different locations

---

## 🔑 Key Features

### ✅ Recurring Shifts
Create shifts that repeat automatically:
- **Daily**: Every day
- **Weekly**: Specific days of the week (e.g., Monday & Wednesday)
- **Monthly**: Same date each month
- **End Date**: Set when recurrence stops

Example: "Every Monday and Wednesday from 9 AM to 5 PM"

### ✅ Conflict Detection
The system automatically prevents:
- **Staff Double-Booking**: Same staff can't be in two places at once
- **Blackout Periods**: Shifts can't be created during blocked times

Conflicts are shown when trying to create/edit a shift.

### ✅ Service Assignments
- Assign multiple services to a single shift
- Set max concurrent bookings per service
- Only qualified staff can be assigned to services (enforced by staff qualifications)

### ✅ Location-Based Scheduling
- Multiple staff can work at the same location simultaneously
- Color-coded by location in calendar view
- Filter shifts by location
