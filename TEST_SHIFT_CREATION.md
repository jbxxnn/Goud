## Troubleshooting

### "No staff members found"
â†’ You need to create at least one staff member first at `/dashboard/staff`

### "Shift conflicts detected"
â†’ The same staff member is already scheduled at that location/time. Either:
- Change the time
- Use a different staff member
- Delete the conflicting shift first

### Form won't submit
â†’ Make sure:
- All required fields (*) are filled
- At least one service is selected
- End time is after start time
- If recurring/weekly, at least one day is selected

### Shift doesn't appear in calendar
â†’ Try:
- Refreshing the page
- Switching to a different view and back
- Checking if the shift date is within the visible date range

## Next Steps

After successfully creating shifts:

1. âœ… Test editing a shift (click on it in the calendar)
2. âœ… Test deleting a shift
3. âœ… Test creating overlapping shifts (to see conflict detection)
4. âœ… Test recurring shifts
5. âœ… Test filtering by staff member
